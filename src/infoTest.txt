Javascript Testing
What to test
-  A single part of your implementation

React Testing

What to test
- If a component renders with or without props
- How a component renders with state changes
- How a component reacts to user interactions
- Note: You do not need to test the actual implementation
  of a functionality. Just test if the component
  is behaving correctly.
